# moonshot_pool
Game Off 2020 in-progress submission


Placeholder art for now

Based off a standard game of pool, but the target balls are point gravity fields, making the cueball curve.

Want to add fuzzed predicted routes and visible zones of gravity.

Want to change the art to represent better the idea of some god playing pool with planets with a space background.
